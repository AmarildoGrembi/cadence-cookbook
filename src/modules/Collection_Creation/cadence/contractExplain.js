export const contractExplain = `This Collection Resource is used to hold all of your NFT resources. It is one of the first instances you will see where a resource owns another resource.

Within the collection there are also functions that lay out how to withdraw, deposit, check if an NFT exists, return all NFTS, and destory NFTS.

You usually include a interface (NFTReceiver) to your collection so that others may deposit, check if NFTS exist, and get their ID's from an account.
