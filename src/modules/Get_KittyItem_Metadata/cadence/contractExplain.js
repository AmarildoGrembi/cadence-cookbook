export const contractExplain = `As we can see in the NFT for the KittyItems NFT there are two functions related to the MetadataViews Contract.

One is getViews that returns you all the views that this NFT possesses. A view is a type of structure that lays out different metadata and makes it easily viewable when retrieving an NFT.

There is also a resolveView function, that take the view which you choose to use for looking at an NFTS metadata, and lays out its structure for you in an easily digestable view.

Our KittyItems contract leverages the Metadata standard to make views for this NFT accessible to anyone.
